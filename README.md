## 🩺 Health Risk Prediction System (Diabetes)

A full-stack machine learning web application that predicts the risk of diabetes based on patient medical parameters.
The system integrates data analysis, machine learning, FastAPI backend, and a React frontend to deliver real-time predictions.

### 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate an end-to-end ML pipeline, starting from data analysis and model training to deployment-ready backend APIs and a professional frontend UI.

### Key Highlights:

1)Complete EDA & ML model training

2)Robust data preprocessing & evaluation

3)FastAPI backend for inference

4)React.js frontend with medical-style UI

5)Clean separation of training vs production

6)Resume & interview-ready architecture

### 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline
##### 1. Data Analysis & EDA

Explored feature distributions

Identified skewness and outliers

Treated invalid zero values as missing

Visualized feature–target relationships

##### 2. Data Preprocessing

Median imputation for missing values

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Outlier analysis using IQR & visualization

##### 3. Model Training

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

ROC–AUC (≈ 0.81)

##### 4. Model Optimization

Threshold tuning

Hyperparameter tuning

Feature importance analysis

Final decision based on data overlap & ROC-AUC
